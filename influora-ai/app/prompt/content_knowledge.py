"""Influora's own video-content knowledge, rendered as a cached system block
for CREATOR turns only.

Why this exists (Swapnil, 2026-09-21): when a creator asks "how do I grow my
channel?", Meera answers from Influora's content knowledge FIRST -- the
creator's category, then a named storytelling structure, hook template and
camera angles from this file -- and only falls back to general knowledge when
nothing here fits. Standing test (wiki/decisions/2026-09-21-one-ai-that-
reduces-work.md): the point is fewer steps for the creator, not a cleverer
answer. The persona rules that tell the model HOW to use this block live in
`app/prompt/creator_persona.py`; this module only loads, validates and renders.

Data: `app/prompt/knowledge/video_content_concepts.jsonl` (84 rows, v3 2026-09-22). It sits
under `app/prompt/` on purpose: `ci/stale-comment-check.py` watches that prefix
(PROMPT_SOURCES), so editing the data forces a PROMPT_VERSION bump exactly like
a persona edit does -- the rendered text is prompt content.

Fail-loud contract: every row is validated (known `data_type`, required fields
present and non-empty) and the block is rendered at IMPORT time into
`CREATOR_KNOWLEDGE_TEXT`. `assembler.py` imports this module, and
`app.main` imports the chat route that imports the assembler, so a malformed
file stops the service at startup and fails every prompt test -- it can never
fail silently in the middle of a creator's chat.

Tenant-agnostic: zero creator data. Safe to cache globally (same rule as
Block A).
